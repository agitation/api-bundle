     * their former position in the payload to their position in the list.

     * tree contains the same objects over and over again, as they don't know
     * how to cross-referencing the same object at various positions in a tree.
     * Therefore, we do it ourselves and save a lot of ressources.
     *
     * Sample code for unfolding this structure can be found in various places
     * in the `examples` section of the SDK.
